# Jira Confluence Automator

The Jira Confluence Automator is a Python script designed to streamline task management by automatically converting incomplete Confluence tasks into Jira issues. This tool enhances efficiency by integrating Confluence-based task tracking with Jira's robust issue management capabilities.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Comprehensive Logging**: Generates detailed logs for all operations, facilitating easy tracking, debugging, and auditing.
* **Undo Capability**: Includes a dedicated script to revert all changes made during the automation process.
* **Secure Configuration**: Utilizes environment variables for sensitive credentials and a JSON file for general configuration.
